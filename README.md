## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Upon loading, the page presents a welcoming message and two buttons: "Start" and "Stop".
2. **Start Effect**: Clicking the "Start" button initiates a JavaScript interval that changes the heading's color every 500 milliseconds.
3. **Stop Effect**: Clicking the "Stop" button halts the color-changing effect, stabilizing the heading's color.
4. **Styling**: CSS is used to center the content, style the buttons, and ensure the layout is visually appealing and responsive.
